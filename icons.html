            <p class="lead">Icons are symbols used to represent features, functionality, or content, and provide visual context and enhance usability.</p>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Five types of icons are used to communicate information with variations based on use case and representation.</p>

            <p><i class="fas fa-bell"></i> <strong>Utility</strong> icons are simple, single-color glyphs that identify labels and actions across form factors.</p>

            <p><i class="fas fa-wrench"></i> <strong>Object</strong> icons fall into two categories: Standard and Custom object icons.</p>

            <p><i class="fas fa-edit"></i> <strong>Action</strong> icons are touch-device specific icons that appear next to an item to let users take action in a specific context.</p>

            <p><i class="fas fa-file"></i> <strong>Doctype</strong> icons represent document file formats.</p>

            <p><i class="fas fa-desktop"></i> <strong>Product</strong> icons represent applications using product logos that launch the corresponding mobile app.</p>

            <p>The primary reason a designer might choose icons rather than text is simple: icons take up less space. This has risen to the top of the priority list for many designers as our screens and devices get smaller, and responsive design gains traction. An icon is a small, quick, intuitive representation of an action, a status, or an app.</p>

            <p>A company might need beginner users to immediately understand an icon's meaning, and therefore might include text in addition to an icon. Other companies with internal applications will go so far as to train users to recognize new or unusual icons. A learning curve is not a negative thing in this situation, and even more so if the trade off is to communicate complex ideas in a limited space.</p>

            <p>Learners of application programs are aided in initial learning by the use of either icons with text labels or text labels alone. However, text labels play an important role briefly in the early stage of learning, but after that they lose their value. From this, it appears that labels may be suppressed after the users have worked with the program for a relatively short time. Initially show labels, with an easy to locate option to turn them off.</p>

            <h2>Icons within apps</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Icons need to instantly tell the user where the interactions are in an interface.</li>
                <li>In short, they are signposts, and tell the user &#8220;This way to the important stuff&#8221;.</li>
                <li>Icons within an app should all feel like they belong to the same family. This helps to build the brand of the product and creates a trustworthy reputation across all interactions in the app.</li>
                <li>It is also important that the icons we design for our own apps bear at least some resemblance to common icons found in other apps. At first this may sound like a barrier to creativity but in fact it's an opportunity for increased usability. Users are so used to the way things currently work on a device that shifting too much from the norm is more likely to be a hindrance than a success.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Sizes</h2>
            <p>Icons are auto-scaled to provide four additional sizes: small (16px), medium (24px), large (32px), x-large (48px). Exceptions to this are object icons which only have two sizes and are custom designed. Now, on my Symbols page I created a Rectangle (R) 24x24 and removed the Fill Color. This would then act as the Bounding Box for all of my Icons moving forward, so even if there was a slight difference in the actual icon size, theyâ€™ll always be contained inside of the 24pt Bounding Box for when it comes to alignment and adhering to the 8pt Grid System in my project(s).</p>
