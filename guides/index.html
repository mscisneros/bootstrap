            <p class="lead">A design system is a centralized collection of guidelines, principles and reusable components that are guided by clear standards, which helps a business reinforce a consistent brand. Also, these guidelines provide an unified language and consistent look and feel when designing websites and products.</p>

            <h2>Design Principles</h2>
            <p>A design system is about bringing order in an effort to fix inefficiency and inconsistency by creating common components and standards for using them.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Eliminate ambiguity. Enable people to see, understand, and act with confidence.</li>
                <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Streamline and optimize workflows. Intelligently anticipate needs to help people work better, smarter, and faster.</li>
                <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Create familiarity and strengthen intuition by applying the same solution to the same problem.</li>
                <li><strong>Beauty:</strong> Demonstrate respect for people&#39;s time and attention through thoughtful and elegant craftsmanship.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Accessibility</h3>
            <p class="mb-0">Accessibility in digital design is the practice of crafting experiences for all people, including those of us with visual, speech, auditory, physical, or cognitive disabilities. An inclusive web made for and consumable by all people.</p>

            <h2>Design System Commonalities</h2>
            <p>Some of the common feature across various and popular design systems:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Style &amp; Design Guidelines</strong>: Typorgraphy, colors, spacing and illustrations, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Pattern Libraries (or component libraries):</strong> Forms, &amp; form elements, images, navigation, overlays, etc.</li>
                <li>Motion Guidelines</li>
                <li><strong>Content Style Guides:</strong> Voice &amp; tone, language, how to write, objectives, principles, etc.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Guides and Libraries</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Style Guide:</strong> The physical or digital document that represents the styles, patterns, practices, and principles of a company/brand and how to use it.</li>
                <li><strong>Pattern Library:</strong> An organized set of related, reusable components, often containing code examples, design guidelines, and use cases.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Design system patterns are usually tested with end&#45;users, thus can be easily assembled into new features. If properly set up, experimented, tested and maintained a well&#45;defined system is one of the best designer&#39;s friends. Furthermore, a living design system is one of the most important step-ups for mature designops and UX design organizations. In short, the comprehensive set of values, semantics, syntax, and context that form the foundation of a shared design language.</p>
