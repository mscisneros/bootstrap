            <p class="lead">A design system is a centralized collection of guidelines, principles and reusable components that are guided by clear standards, which helps a business reinforce a consistent brand. Also, these guidelines provide an unified language and consistent look and feel when designing websites and products.</p>

            <h2 class="border-top  pt-5">Building a Design System</h2>
            <p ><mark>Color, space and typography</mark> are the core building blocks for a solid design system. These three focus areas are what create distinctive, recognizable and unique brands.</p>

            <h3>Key Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Design Audit:</strong> Review every single application and website, and identify common components and collect all contexts and use cases.</li>
                <li><strong>Design Language:</strong> The visual design language is the core of a design system, and is made up of the discernible components that you&#39;ll use to construct your digital product. Your visual design language is made up of four main categories:

                    <ol class="my-2  ml-4" type="a">
                        <li><strong>Color:</strong> Common colors in a design system include 1–3 primaries that represent your brand. You may want to include a range of tints (a color mixed with white &ndash; and shades &ndash; a color mixed with black &ndash; to give your designs a few more options.</li>
                        <li><strong>Typography:</strong> Most design systems include just 2 fonts: 1 font for both headings and body copy, and a monospace font for code. Keep it simple to avoid overloading and confusing your user, and it also prevents performance issues caused by excessive use of web fonts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sizing and Spacing:</strong> The system you use for spacing and sizing looks best when you have rhythm and balance. A 4-based scale is growing in popularity as the recommended scale due to its use in iOS and Android standards, ICO size formats, and even the standard browser font size.</li>
                        <li><strong>Imagery:</strong> The key to success with imagery is following a set guidelines for illustrations and icons, and using the best image format for the situation.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <div class="pull-quote  d-none  d-md-block">
                        <p>Design systems are always evolving, and the way you share and encourage adoption of new iterations will evolve along the way as well. <br> <span>&#45;Diana Mounter, Design Systems Manager at GitHub</span></p>
                    </div>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Create a UI/pattern library:</strong> Unlike the visual audit you’ve already conducted (which looked at the visual qualities of your design elements), this step in the process looks at the actual components of your UI. Collect all of the parts and pieces of your UI currently in production. That means every button, form, modal, and image. Merge and remove what you don’t need.</li>
                <li><strong>Document what each component is and when to use it:</strong> This step is important. Documentation and standards are what separate a pattern library from a true design system.</li>
                <li><strong>Scale:</strong> Ability to scale the system to meet future needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Ability to collaborate and maintain the system in real&#45;time.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexible:</strong> System that is flexible enough to adapt to project demands.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Design Tokens</h3>
            <p>Design tokens are the “subatomic” foundation of a design system implementation. At its simplest, they’re name and value pairs stored as data to abstract the design properties you want to manage. With the values for all design tokens stored in a single place, it’s easier to achieve consistency while reducing the burden of managing your design system.</p>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong> $brand-primary-color : #1C4DBF;</p>

            <p>In design tokens you can store colors, spacing, sizing, etc., and distribute them to various platforms.</p>
