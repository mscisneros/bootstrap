// Project: GiddyUp Design System Starter Kit
// Imports: Partial Sass Files
// Updated: February 5, 2020
// Note: The main.scss file is the top-level Sass file where the entire project is stitched together


// ABSTRACTS
// Abstracts (or Utilities): holds Sass tools, helper files, variables, functions, mixins, extend and other config files.
// These files are meant to be just helpers which don’t output any CSS when compiled.
@import "abstracts/variables"; // INIT VARIABLES


// BASE
// Basic building blocks, typically single html tags
// Base holds the boilerplate code for the project that includes common styles such as colors, sizes, resets and typographic rules.
@import "base/document";
@import "base/links";
@import "base/typography";


// COMPONENTS (or MODULES)
// Simple combinations of core and reusable components not tied to a specific section.
// Holds all of your styles for buttons, carousels, sliders, and similar page components (think widgets).
// Your project will typically contain a lot of component files — as the whole site/app should be mostly composed of small modules.
@import "components/accordion";
@import "components/buttons";
@import "components/card";
@import "components/jumbotron";
@import "components/panel";


// LAYOUT
// distinct section of an interface
@import "layout/footer";
@import "layout/header";
@import "layout/sidebar";


// PAGE
// Layouts and specific styles stitched together to form individual pages.
@import "pages/buttons";
@import "pages/colors";
@import "pages/home";


// Core
@import "base/breakpoints";


// TERMINAL
// cd /Users/mariocisneros/Documents/Projects/Websites/giddyup/
// sass --watch scss/main.scss:css/custom.css
