and allow us to scale up elements as the viewport changes.

// Extra small (xs) devices (portrait phones, less than 576px)
// No media query since this is the default in Bootstrap



// Small devices (landscape phones, 576px and up)



// Medium devices (tablets, 768px and up)



// Large devices (desktops, 992px and up)



// Extra large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up)

// Itâ€™s worth noting the -*-text-size-adjust: 100%; declarations have been used to prevent some mobile browsers from increasing the font size of their own accord.


// Why is the container max widths different than the grid-breakpoints?
// In other words, if the breakpoint for lg is 992, why not have all containers max-width be 992 on resolutions 992 and below?
// Between 768 and 991 the max container width is 720 as anything larger at 768 wouldn't fit without having space or gutters.
// The 720 value is arbitrary, which could be potentially a size where the grid values are whole numbers.
