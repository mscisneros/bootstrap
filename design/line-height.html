            <p class="lead">Line spacing is the space between two lines of text, or more specifically, it&#39;s the exact distance between two adjacent baselines, and a very important aspect of user experience design because it has a huge impact on the readability of text in a digital device.</p>

            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Using the same line&#45;height for all text is a very subtle, but common mistake because 1.5 may work great for body copy, but as text gets larger, your line-height should get tighter.</p>

            <h3>5 rules for line spacing:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Aim for about 140%-180% for optimal readability and accessibility</strong>. Any smaller and the text will be cramped and difficult to read. Go much larger and the eye can get lost.</li>

                <li><strong>Limit line length to 70&#45;80 characters</strong>. Longer lines of text can confuse the eye, particularly when reading text on a screen. <mark>If you must use longer lines, increase the line spacing to help protect readability.</mark></li>

                <li><strong>Font size should be minimum 16pt</strong>. This is a long-standing rule of thumb that still applies.</li>

                <li><strong>Small fonts need more spacing</strong>. Line spacing should actually increase with smaller font sizes. This is because smaller fonts are already more difficult to read, and need more space around them for the eye to easily follow.</li>

                <li><strong>Check your line spacing when you change font or font size</strong>. Different fonts have different maximum heights (x-heights) even when they&#39;re the same size in points. So you need to be sure that when you change font, you check to see how your line spacing feels in readability terms.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to calculate the ideal line spacing</h3>
            <p>You may need to do some basic arithmetic to find the optimum line spacing. For example, if your font is 18pt, and we&#39;re aiming for line spacing of 150%, simply multiply the font size by 1.5 and you have the correct line spacing value: 27pt.
