            <p class="lead">Color is a fundamental building block in your design system, and will influence everything you&#39;ll build &ndash; from backgrounds and typography to components.</p>

            <h2>The 60-30-10 rule</h2>
            <p>When applying a color scheme it helps to start by applying a tried-and-true design principle: the 60-30-10 Rule. The basics of the rule is to choose a primary color that dominates 60% of the area; a secondary color to compromise about 30% of the visual field; and an accent color that provides a 10% color pop. The formula works because it allows the eye to move comfortably from one focal point to the next.</p>

            <h3>It&#39;s also incredibly simple to use:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>60% is your dominant hue:</strong>
                    <p>Use your primary color for <mark>backgrounds, color blocking and large text areas</mark>.</p>
                </li>

                <li><strong>30% is your secondary color:</strong>
                    <p>Use your secondary color for <mark>headlines, sidebars, highlighting or text callouts</mark>.</p>
                </li>

                <li><strong>10% is for an accent color:</strong>
                    <p>Then use your accent color, typically your boldest color, to guide the reader to take a particular action. Use it for areas you want to draw the eye to such as <mark>call-to-action areas, buttons and links</mark>.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mt-0">To visualize this rule in use, think of a man in a business suit: 60% is the slacks and jacket, 30% is the shirt, and 10% is the tie.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s important to define your primary colors, which consist of between one and three colors, but could contain more, and is the color displayed most frequently across your app or website. It&#39;s common to begin with a 3-color scheme and if you have a &#8220;signature color&#8220; &ndash; use it as one of the three colors. Then decide the percentage usage (primary, secondary and accent) for each of the three colors. <mark>If you need to add a fourth or fifth color, split either the primary or secondary colors and add a lighter or darker shade of that color to the mix.</mark> Just remember to still keep that color split within its designated percentage. For example, if you split your primary color to add a lighter hue, the 60% would change to something like 40% original color plus 20% lighter hue. <strong>Important:</strong> Resist splitting your accent color as this will dilute the punch you need this color to convey.</p>

            <h2>Primary Colors</h2>
            <p>Think of primary colors as your parent colors, anchoring your design in a general color scheme. Any one or combination of these colors can give your brand guardrails when you move to explore other shades, tones, and tints. When designing don&#39;t feel restricted to just the three primary colors. For example, orange isn&#39;t a primary color, but brands can certainly use orange as their dominant color.</p>

            <h3>There are three primary colors:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Red</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Yellow</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Blue</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Secondary Colors</h2>
            <p>There are three secondary colors, <strong>orange</strong>, <strong>purple</strong> and <strong>green</strong>, which are formed by combining any two of the three primary colors listed above.</p>

            <h3>The following are the general rules of secondary color creation:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Red + Yellow = <strong>Orange</strong></li>
                <li>Blue + Red = <strong>Purple</strong></li>
                <li>Yellow + Blue = <strong>Green</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Keep in mind that the color mixtures above only work if you use the purest form, known as a color&#39;s <em>hue</em>, of each primary color.</p>

            <p>However, <mark>sometimes brand colors include a tertiary and accent palette set</mark>, which can make your UI more interesting. For example, accent colors are used to emphasize certain elements such as buttons, graphs or progress bars, and usually have more brightness and saturation &ndash; such visual properties are more visually engaging and encourage user interactions.</p>

            <h2>There are two common methods to tackling color steps:</h2>

            <div class="pull-quote  d-none  d-sm-block  mt-2">
                Darker colour variations are made by lowering brightness and increasing saturation. Brighter color variations are made by increasing brightness and lowering saturation.

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Shades:</strong> By simply adjusting the opacity of a color, you can change its shade. However, shades also tend to create a less vibrant set of colors as they appear more dull as they get lighter, therefore use this method on simple interactions like hovers, links and possibly borders.</li>

                <li class="mt-4"><strong>Tints:</strong> Adjusting brightness and saturation on each of your base colors. You&#39;ll be mimicking how color is perceived in nature when light and shadow falls onto a color. Perhaps a little more technical than adjusting color with shades, but a much better approach, with less drawbacks and a more vibrant set of color steps.</li>

            <h3>Extended Palette</h3>
            <p>The extended palette consists of all the useable tints and shades of each color in the palette. Usage of these colors varies depending on the touch point, but they come in handy for illustrations and components in product.</p>

            <h2>Review</h2>
            <ul class="pl-4">
                <li>Start with one color you like and build the color scheme from there because if you try and start with more than one color, you&#39;ll have a harder time finding harmony between your colors.</li>
                <li>Use colors purposefully to communicate how things function in the interface.
                    <ul class="pl-3">
                        <li>This helps create visual patterns that can make interacting with a product or website easier and more predictable for users.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Grays have a supportive role and are usually made for text and background.</li>
                <li>Use any light background color with its corresponding text color.</li>
                <li>Use any primary background color with white text.</li>
                <li>Use white background with any dark text color.</li>
