# Overview
A design system is a centralized collection of guidelines, principles and reusable components that are guided by clear standards, which helps a business reinforce a consistent brand. These guidelines and components provide a unified language and consistent look and feel when designing websites, apps and products.

## Design Principles
* Clarity: Eliminate ambiguity. Enable people to see, understand, and act with confidence.
* Efficiency: Streamline and optimize workflows.
* Consistency: Create familiarity and strengthen intuition by applying the same solution to the same problem.
* Beauty: Demonstrate respect for people's time and attention through thoughtful and elegant craftsmanship.
